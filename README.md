## Check out the [deployed app](https://lukes-amazing-note-taker.herokuapp.com/notes) on heroku

A little express app to help you keep track of your very important thoughts. Have you ever lost track of something important you wanted to remember, and raised your fist to the sky and cursed the names of the  tech titans who never thought to even give you a simple note-taking app? We've all been there. But fret not, those days are now at an end.

## Usage

Simply type a note title and body into the page, and click the floppy disk icon to save the note. It will appear in the sidebar for you to revisit it again and again. Or to delete, if you choose. These little notes' lives are in your hands. And why not? You created them.
